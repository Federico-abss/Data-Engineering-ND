# Udacity Data Engineering

Learn to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, and work with massive datasets. At the end of the program, youâ€™ll combine your new skills by completing a capstone project.

### Data Modeling

Learn to create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data consumers. Use ETL to build databases in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.

[- Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](/Cassandra%20ETL/)

### Cloud Data Warehouses

Sharpen your data warehousing skills and deepen your understanding of data infrastructure. Create cloud-based data warehouses on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

[- Build a Cloud Data Warehouse](/Data%20WRH)

### Spark and Data Lakes

Understand the big data ecosystem and how to use Spark to work with massive datasets. Store big data in a data lake and query it with Spark.

[- Build a Data Lake](/Data%20Lake)

### Data Pipelines with Airflow

Schedule, automate, and monitor data pipelines using Apache Airflow. Run data quality checks, track data lineage, and work with data pipelines in production.
